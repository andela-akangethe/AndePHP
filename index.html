<h1 id="php-curriculum">PHP Curriculum</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>PHP is a really awesome language to learn either as a beginner or as an expert. When I initially began learning PHP, I felt lost and did not know where to begin. I hope this documentation will make your life profoundly easier and you will have fun as you enjoy the glory that is PHP.</p>
<p>At the end of this documentation you will be a ninja with the great power. Remember with great power comes great responsibility. Enjoy :-)</p>
<h2 id="basic-php-syntax">Basic PHP Syntax</h2>
<p>Below is just an appetiser so that you know the basics.</p>
<p>Ok let's begin with the absolute basic piece of information. The default file extension for PHP files is ".php".</p>
<p>A PHP script can be placed anywhere in the .php file. Below is an example</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

   /**
    * PHP code goes here
    */

  echo "This stuff doesn't seem soooo difficult, right?";
</code></pre>
<h3 id="echo">Echo</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"So how do you output to a browser?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To display anything on the browser.</p>
<pre><code>  echo "This is cool";
  echo 'Huh! So you can also use a single quotation mark. Intersting.';
  echo ("This is also cool");
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Awesome. Quick question whats the difference between having "" in echo vs '' ?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main differnce between using "" and '' when dealing with echo is fairly simple.</p>
<pre><code>$age = 10;

echo "I have always taken desert after supper since I was $age years old."

// The output will be:- I have always taken desert after supper since I was 10 years old.

To achieve the same results using '' one would have to do the following

echo 'I have always taken desert after supper since I was' . $age . 'years old.'

This is called concatenating. This basically means add to the sentence $age.

// This is still ok

echo "I have always taken desert after supper since I was" . $age . "years old."
</code></pre>
<h3 id="comments-in-php">Comments in PHP</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"How can I leave myself or future coders information about what a specific piece of code is supposed to do?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To achieve this you comment about that piece of code. An example is shown above. Another example can be found below. There are many ways of commenting.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

  // This is a single-line comment

  # This is also a single-line comment

  /* *
   * This is a multiple-lines comment block
   * that spans over multiple
   * lines
  */
</code></pre>
<h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>
<p>They are used to store information. To proper understand what variables are think of them as boxes in which the information is placed inside of them.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot" src="./img/variable.jpg" /></p>
<p>When the stored information is needed back it can be retrieved.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot" src="./img/variable2.jpg" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Cool, so what do I need to know about variables?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are the most important things to know about variables in PHP.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They are denoted by a dollar sign ($)</p>
<pre><code>$variable = 3;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Variables can be declared before they are assigned some information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Variables are assigned values using the equal (=) sign as shown above</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The value of the most recent variable overides that of the previous</p>
<pre><code>$variable = 3;
$variable = 5;

echo $variable; // You will see 5
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suppose the variable name consists of two or more words eg school books, in PHP best practice dictates that we write such a variable as follows :-</p>
<pre><code>$school_books = ['Math Book', 'Science Book'];
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see above we separate the two words making the variable name with an underscore</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Huh! are there different types of variables?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a matter of fact, yes. PHP supports the following data types.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Integers − These whole numbers, without a decimal point, eg. 4195. They can be either positive or negative. Integers can be specified in three formats: decimal (10-based), hexadecimal (16-based - prefixed with 0x) or octal (8-based - prefixed with 0)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doubles − These are decimal point numbers eg. 3.14159 or 49.0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Booleans − Can either be true or false</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NULL − This is a very special type that only has one value ie. NULL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strings − These are sequences of characters, take for instance 'The value of pie is 3.142'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arrays − These are named and indexed collections of other values</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Objects − These data type stores data and information on how to process that data. They must be explicitly declared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resources − These are special variables that hold references to resources external to PHP (such as database connections).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Well Jeez! Some of these data types sound complex. How will I get to understand them?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will go though each and every one of these data types, breaking down doors until you have mastered each.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot" src="./img/doors.jpg" /></p>
<h3 id="arrays">Arrays</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"So, what is an array?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To best understand what arrays are and how to use them let's look at a simple example.</p>
<pre><code> &lt;?php

// Suppose you want to store the days of the week this could be represented as

$day1 = 'Monday';
$day2 = 'Tuesday';
$day3 = 'Wednesday';
$day4 = 'Thursday';
$day5 = 'Friday';
$day6 = 'Saturday';
$day7 = 'Sunday';

// This is could work, but there is a more efficient way

$days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday'];

// $days is an array variable.
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see above declaring the days of the week as an array is more efficient.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Huh! Now that I understand what an array is, how can I access the elements of the array?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To best understand how to access the array elements, let's continue with the above</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

// Suppose you want to store the days of the week this could be represented as

$day1 = 'Monday';
$day2 = 'Tuesday';
$day3 = 'Wednesday';
$day4 = 'Thursday';
$day5 = 'Friday';
$day6 = 'Saturday';
$day7 = 'Sunday';

// This is could work, but there is a more efficient way

// $days is an array variable.

$days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday'];

// To display the array elements you can either use print_r() or var_dump()

var_dump($days);

/**
 * The output for var_dump will be
 *    array(7) {
 *        [0]=&gt;
 *        string(6) "Monday"
 *        [1]=&gt;
 *        string(7) "Tuesday"
 *        [2]=&gt;
 *        string(9) "Wednesday"
 *        [3]=&gt;
 *        string(8) "Thursday"
 *        [4]=&gt;
 *        string(6) "Friday"
 *        [5]=&gt;
 *        string(8) "Saturday"
 *         [6]=&gt;
 *        string(6) "Sunday"
 *    }
 */

  print_r($days)
  /**
   * The output will be
   * Array
   * (
   *     [0] =&gt; Monday
   *     [1] =&gt; Tuesday
   *     [2] =&gt; Wednesday
   *     [3] =&gt; Thursday
   *     [4] =&gt; Friday
   *     [5] =&gt; Saturday
   *     [6] =&gt; Sunday
   * )
   */

  /**
   * As you can see above the dates are indexed starting from zero ie Monday is
   * indexed 0 and Sunday is indexed 6
   */

  // To dispay Wednesday

  echo $days[2]; // Outputs Wednesday
</code></pre>
<p>Let's dissect the result obtainined above when we do <code>print_r($days)</code>
[0], [1], [2] etc seen above are called the keys while Monday, Tuesday etc are called the values</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"What if I don't want to have those horibble keys and want to customize my keys can I be able to do so?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a matter of fact, yes. We call that type of array an associative array.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a list of employees and you want to keep track of how old they are</p>
<pre><code>  &lt;?php 
  $employee = [
    "Samuel" =&gt; "35 years",
    "Bonny"  =&gt; "25 years",
    "Clyde"  =&gt; "20 years",
  ];

  echo $employee["Clyde"]; // Outputs 20 years
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Awesome. Now that I get what arrays are and how to use get information from them can I do anything else with them say, add and remove items in the array?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. Below is an example of how to add an element into an array.</p>
<pre><code>  &lt;?php

  // Let's use the days of the week example
  $days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"];

  /**
   * To add Sunday we use array_push() which accepts two values ie the name of 
   * the array and the value you intend to add
   */

  array_push($days, "Sunday");


  // Alternatively to add Sunday we can also use

  $days[] = "Sunday";

  // To see if Sunday has been added

  print_r($days);

  /**
   * The output is
   * Array
   * (
   *   [0] =&gt; Monday
   *   [1] =&gt; Tuesday
   *   [2] =&gt; Wednesday
   *   [3] =&gt; Thursday
   *   [4] =&gt; Friday
   *   [5] =&gt; Saturday
   *   [6] =&gt; Sunday
   * )
   *
   */
</code></pre>
<p>Now to remove the last item that we have added in the days of the week ie Sunday we use array_pop</p>
<pre><code>  &lt;?php

  // Let's use the days of the week example
  $days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday'];

  array_pop($days);

  print_r($days);

  /**
   * The output is
   * Array
   * (
   *   [0] =&gt; Monday
   *   [1] =&gt; Tuesday
   *   [2] =&gt; Wednesday
   *   [3] =&gt; Thursday
   *   [4] =&gt; Friday
   *   [5] =&gt; Saturday
   * )
   *
   */
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ok, some of you might be like "But Sunday is the first day of the week not Monday how can I reflect that?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's easy</p>
<pre><code>  &lt;?php

  // Let's declaire the days of the week

  $days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday'];

  array_unshift($days, "Sunday");

  print_r($days);

  /**
   *  Array
   * (
   *    [0] =&gt; Sunday
   *    [1] =&gt; Monday
   *    [2] =&gt; Tuesday
   *    [3] =&gt; Wednesday
   *    [4] =&gt; Thursday
   *    [5] =&gt; Friday
   *    [6] =&gt; Saturday
   * )
   *
   */
</code></pre>
<p>Depending on your needs there are so many array functions that you may want to use.For a comprehensive list of said functions go to <a href="http://za1.php.net/manual/en/book.array.php">php.net</a></p>
<h3 id="conditions">Conditions</h3>
<p>We as humans make decisions every day. Do I wake up or sleep in? Do I buy this or that etc. Computers also have that ability. PHP uses if, elseif and switch statements to make to fulfil this task.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot" src="./img/conditions.png" /></p>
<h4 id="if-statements">If statements</h4>
<pre><code>  &lt;?php

  $day = "Friday";

  if($day == "Friday") {
    echo "Yipee tomorrow I sleep in.";
  } else {
    echo "Noooooo tomorrow I have to wake up early";
  }

  // Output will be Yipee tomorrow I sleep in.
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"What! why are we using two == signs?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great observation. We use one = sign to assign values to a variable and  == or === signs in if statements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"So what it the diferrence between == and === sign?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To best explain this let's look at an example</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

  $day = "Friday";

  if($day == true) {
    echo "Yipee tomorrow I sleep in.";
  } else {
    echo "Noooooo tomorrow I have to wake up early";
  }

  // Output will be Yipee tomorrow I sleep in.


  &lt;?php

  $day = "Friday";

  if($day === "Friday") {
    echo "Yipee tomorrow I sleep in.";
  } else {
    echo "Noooooo tomorrow I have to wake up early";
  }

  // Output will be Yipee tomorrow I sleep in.
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Say whaaaat?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, so this may be a little bit confusing but trust me its not. In the first case the == sign does not check the datatype it check if its a truthy value. Since <code>$day</code>is not equal to an empty string, it does have values then it's a truthy value.</p>
<p>Three equal signs ie === is used when you want to be as explicit as possible.</p>
<h4 id="elseif">Elseif</h4>
<p>As you have seen above you use if statement when you have to make a deceision between two things but what if you have not one ,not two but many decisions to make, then you use elseif for that</p>
<pre><code>   &lt;?php
     $day = "Friday";

     if ($day === "Friday") {
        echo "Have a nice weekend!";
     } elseif ($d === "Sun") {
        echo "Have a nice Sunday!"; 
     } else {
        echo "Have a nice day!"; 
     }

    // Output is Have a nice weekend!
</code></pre>
<p>Please note that you can change the === with &lt;= , &gt;= , &lt; or &gt;</p>
<pre><code>  $value1 &lt;= $value2 means $value1 is less or equal to $value2
  $value1 &lt; $value2 means $value1 is less than $value2
  $value1 &gt;= $value2 means $value1 is greater or equal to $value2
  $value1 &gt; $value2 means $value1 is greater than $value2
</code></pre>
<p>For a comprehensive list of operators go to <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php">php.net</a></p>
<h4 id="elseif_1">Elseif</h4>
<p>To best expain these let's look at some code</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;?php

    $day = "Sunday";

    switch($day) {
      case "Monday":
        echo "It's Monday";
        break;
      case "Tuesday":
        echo "It's Tuesday";
        break;
      case "Wednesday":
        echo "It's Wednesday";
        break;
      case "Thursday":
        echo "It's Thursday";
        break;
      case "Friday":
        echo "It's Friday";
        break;
      default:
        echo "Hurray it's the weekend!";
    }

    // Outputs hurray it's the weekend
